# TasteBuds - Testing



---

Testing was an ongoing process throughout the development of this project. From the early stages of building functionality to the final design refinements, a range of tools and techniques were used to ensure the application performs as expected.

Google Chrome Developer Tools were used extensively to test layout responsiveness, debug issues, and inspect elements across different screen sizes. Manual testing was also carried out on various devices to ensure the site functions smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Automated tools such as Lighthouse and WAVE were used to assess accessibility, performance, and best practices, helping to improve the overall user experience.

## Validation Testing

### HTML

### HTML Validation

HTML was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). As the project is built using Django, which uses a templating language within HTML files, I validated the HTML by inspecting the fully rendered page in the browser (using "View Page Source") and copying that output into the validator. This ensured that the actual output served to users was compliant with HTML standards.
